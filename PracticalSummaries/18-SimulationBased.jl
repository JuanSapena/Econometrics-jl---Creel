## This provides examples for MSM and SML.
#  The first is an example for MSM that illustrates
#  the problem of "chatter" of the objective 
#  function, which makes extremum estimation
#  difficult. It goes on to explore Bayesian
#  MSM, which is pretty easy to implement.
#  
#  The second is for SML, and shows how simulated
#  discrete dependent variable models can suffer 
#  from discontinuities in the criterion. This can also
#  be dealt with using the Bayesian approach.


########################### MSM Example ###############################

#  MSM exampl. We generate data that follows a Gaussian
#  distribution, and estimate using some
#  simple simulated moments

# conditional mean is usual linear function

using Distributions

## the statistics, averaged over observations
function k(x,y)
    vec(mean([y x.*y x.*(y.^2.0) (x.^2.0).*y], dims=1))
end

## the simulated moments: S replications
using Random
function simulated_moments(θ, x, S, controlchatter)
    controlchatter ? Random.seed!(1234) : nothing
    [k(x, rand.(Normal.(μ(x,θ),1.0))) for _ = 1:S]

# IMPORTANT: try running this with chatter, and without.

########################### SML Example ###############################

## Now an SML example, using a simple Logit model,
#  where there is no actual need for simulation. 
#  However, it does show how simulation can introduce
#  discontinuity. This example controls random numbers,
#  by re-setting the seed for each simulation, which 
#  eliminates the chatter problem seen above. However,
#  discontinuity still causes problems for extremum 
#  estimators.
